# Turtle Recall: Conservation Challenge

My DL scripts for the *[Turtle Recall: Conservation Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/turtle-recall-conservation-challenge)* competition.

### TO-DO

- Compare Cosine Similarity Matrix results with the `elegy` package (Or I can can just cave in and use the `elegy` package itself).
- Fix data augmentation in Dataset class
- Add `albumentations` implementation of the `randaugment` function from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/augmentation-methods-using-albumentations-and-pytorch-35cd135382f8).
- L2 Regularization
